# Task-manager

This is an application where the user can add/update/delete their tasks. So all the CRUD operations are covered. I played around and created the REST APIs to achieve the aforementioned
operations. 
This is mainly backend web development and this application uses the Node/Express.js server and MongoDB for data storage.
For more security, I will be adding JWT authentication soon !!
